## Plugin API 


### The Single Function 

The single function for sending XMPP Messages is `xmpp_enabled`. It can be called directly from any WordPress plugin

`xmpp_enabled($recipient, $message, $subject='', $type='normal');`

* $recipient is a valid (bare or full) JID of the recipient like 'juliet@capulet.net'
* $message is a plain text message to be sent
* $subject is a title line for message. It is usually omitted for chat-type messages
* $type is a type of message. It can be 'chat', 'normal' or 'headline'. See [RFC 3921](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3921.txt) for details

*Example:* `xmpp_send('subscriber@something.com',"Read our new post:\nhttp://something.com/new-post",'New post is published','headline');`


### Create submenu in the XMPP Enabled section 

XMPP Enabled creates it's own section and you're free to use it for your plugins. The code is `'xmpp-enabled'`

*Example:* `add_submenu_page('xmpp-enabled', 'Jabber Comment Notifications', 'Comment Notifications', 'administrator', __FILE__, 'jcommnotify_settings');`
